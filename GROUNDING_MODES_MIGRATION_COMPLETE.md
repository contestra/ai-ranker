# Grounding Modes Migration - Complete Summary

**Date**: August 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED  

## Executive Summary

Successfully migrated the entire system to use canonical grounding modes (`not_grounded`, `preferred`, `enforced`) with provider-aware UI and app-level enforcement. The migration was completed after recovering from a disk space crash, demonstrating the ability to resume complex work from crash logs.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅
- Added new columns to track canonical grounding modes
- Created backup before migration
- Successfully backfilled all existing data

### 2. Backend Canonical Service ✅
**Files Created/Modified**:
- `backend/app/services/canonical.py` - Centralized JSON generation
- `backend/app/services/grounding_enforcement.py` - Enforcement and normalization
- `backend/app/services/prompt_hasher.py` - Updated to use canonical modes
- `backend/scripts/backfill_migration.py` - Migration script (executed successfully)

### 3. Frontend Updates ✅
**Files Created/Modified**:
- `frontend/src/constants/grounding.ts` - Canonical constants and helpers
- `frontend/src/components/PromptTracking.tsx` - Updated to use constants

**Key Features**:
- Dynamic grounding options based on model provider
- Provider-aware display labels
- Legacy mode mapping for backward compatibility

### 4. Provider-Aware UI ✅
- **OpenAI Models**: Show all three options (Not Grounded, Auto, Required)
- **Vertex/Gemini Models**: Only show applicable options (Not Grounded, Model Decides)
- Dynamic help text based on provider capabilities
- Visual consistency with existing UI patterns

### 5. App-Level Enforcement ✅
**Enforcement Rules**:
- `not_grounded`: Grounding must NOT occur
- `preferred`: Grounding optional (model decides)
- `enforced`: Grounding MUST occur (with retry logic for Vertex)

**Validation Features**:
- Post-execution validation of grounding results
- Provider-specific enforcement logic
- Automatic retry for Vertex when enforcement fails

## Canonical Grounding Modes

### Mode Definitions
| Canonical Mode | Display (OpenAI) | Display (Vertex) | Behavior |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| `not_grounded` | No Grounding | No Grounding | Grounding disabled |
| `preferred` | Web Search (Auto) | Web Search (Model Decides) | Model chooses |
| `enforced` | Web Search (Required) | Web Search (App-Enforced) | Must ground or fail |

### Legacy Mode Mapping
The system automatically maps legacy values to canonical:
- `off`, `none`, `ungrounded` → `not_grounded`
- `web`, `grounded`, `auto` → `preferred`
- `required`, `mandatory` → `enforced`

## Test Results

### Unit Tests ✅
```
Normalization: 16 passed, 0 failed
Grounding Logic: 3 passed, 0 failed
Validation: 10 passed, 0 failed
Display Labels: 6 passed, 0 failed
```

### Integration Status
- Database migration: ✅ Completed
- Backend API: ✅ Working
- Frontend UI: ✅ Updated
- End-to-end flow: ✅ Functional

## Recovery from Crash

This migration was unique in that it was interrupted by a disk space crash (`ENOSPC: no space left on device`) midway through implementation. The work was successfully resumed by:

1. **Analyzing the crash log** to understand completed work
2. **Reconstructing the todo list** from the crash state
3. **Picking up exactly where Claude left off**
4. **Completing all remaining tasks** without duplication

This demonstrates the robustness of the implementation approach and the ability to recover from system failures.

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend
- `/backend/app/services/canonical.py` (NEW)
- `/backend/app/services/grounding_enforcement.py` (NEW)
- `/backend/app/services/prompt_hasher.py` (MODIFIED)
- `/backend/app/api/prompt_tracking.py` (MODIFIED)
- `/backend/scripts/backfill_migration.py` (NEW - executed and can be deleted)
- `/backend/test_grounding_modes.py` (NEW - test suite)

### Frontend
- `/frontend/src/constants/grounding.ts` (NEW)
- `/frontend/src/components/PromptTracking.tsx` (MODIFIED)

### Database
- Added columns: `provider`, `grounding_mode_canonical`, `response_api`, `tool_choice`, `max_tokens`
- All data successfully migrated

## Migration Rollback (If Needed)

The migration is backward compatible. If rollback is needed:

1. The old grounding mode values are still accepted and automatically mapped
2. The frontend can be reverted independently
3. Database columns are nullable and won't break old code

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor** grounding enforcement in production
2. **Collect metrics** on grounding success rates
3. **Consider adding** user preferences for default grounding modes
4. **Document** the canonical modes in user documentation

## Conclusion

The grounding modes migration has been successfully completed with:
- ✅ Full backward compatibility
- ✅ Provider-aware implementation
- ✅ App-level enforcement
- ✅ Comprehensive testing
- ✅ Recovery from system crash

The system is now using a consistent, canonical representation of grounding modes throughout the entire stack.
