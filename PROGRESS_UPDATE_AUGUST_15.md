# Progress Update - August 15, 2025

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Vertex Project Permissions Issue
- **Problem**: Wrong GCP project (llm-entity-probe) was being used instead of contestra-ai
- **Root Cause**: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable pointing to old service account
- **Solution**: 
  - Re-authenticated ADC with correct project
  - Created wrapper script to remove problematic env var
  - Explicitly pass project to Vertex adapter
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Vertex tests now running with correct project

### 2. Production Architecture Implementation
- ✅ Created clean adapter architecture (types.py, adapters, orchestrator)
- ✅ Type safety with Pydantic models throughout
- ✅ Fail-closed semantics for REQUIRED grounding mode
- ✅ SDK workarounds for missing OpenAI parameters
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 14 unit tests passing
- ✅ API endpoints for grounding test grid

### 3. Test Grid UI Component
- ✅ Created GroundingTestGrid.tsx React component
- ✅ 4-column visual grid (GPT/Gemini × Grounded/Ungrounded)
- ✅ Country selector with ALS blocks
- ✅ Real-time test status indicators
- ✅ Shows grounding metrics and latency

## 🔄 Current Status

### Test Results (2/4 Passing)
| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| OpenAI Ungrounded | ✅ PASS | Working correctly |
| OpenAI Grounded | ❌ FAIL | Web search not being performed |
| Vertex Ungrounded | ✅ PASS | Valid JSON returned |
| Vertex Grounded | ❌ FAIL | Grounding metadata not detected |

### Issues Being Investigated
1. **OpenAI Grounding**: Responses API accepting tools parameter but not performing web search
2. **Vertex Grounding**: GoogleSearch tool configured but not being invoked

## 📝 Remaining Tasks

1. **Fix OpenAI grounding** - Investigate why web_search tool isn't being invoked
2. **Fix Vertex grounding** - Debug GoogleSearch tool configuration
3. **Integrate UI component** - Add GroundingTestGrid to main dashboard
4. **Update prompt tracking** - Migrate to new orchestrator architecture
5. **Add preflight checks** - Verify API capabilities at startup

## 🎯 Key Achievements

- **Production-grade architecture** implemented per ChatGPT's guidance
- **Type safety** throughout with Pydantic models
- **Clean separation** of concerns with adapters and orchestrator
- **Vertex permissions** issue completely resolved
- **JSON schema enforcement** working for structured outputs

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Environment Variables**: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS can override ADC
2. **Project Configuration**: Must explicitly pass project to Vertex client
3. **SDK Limitations**: OpenAI SDK doesn't fully support Responses API features
4. **Grounding Complexity**: Web search tools require specific prompt patterns to activate

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Debug why grounding tools aren't being invoked
2. Test with different prompt patterns that might trigger grounding
3. Consider using different models or API versions
4. Integrate the UI component into the main application
