# Grounding Implementation Success Report - August 15, 2025

## üéâ Major Achievement: OpenAI Grounding Working!

### What We Fixed

1. **OpenAI Responses API Grounding** ‚úÖ
   - Changed `tool_choice` from "auto" to "required" to force web search
   - Fixed usage field Pydantic validation errors
   - Used prompts that require current information ("as of today")
   - **Result**: OpenAI now performs web searches and returns source URLs!

2. **Vertex Permissions** ‚úÖ  
   - Fixed wrong GCP project (was using llm-entity-probe)
   - Re-authenticated ADC with contestra-ai project
   - Created wrapper script to clean environment variables
   - **Result**: Vertex tests now run with correct permissions

3. **ALS System Protected** ‚úÖ
   - Kept ALS blocks completely intact
   - Only changed prompts for grounded tests
   - Ungrounded tests still use original locale probe
   - **Result**: ALS system remains untouched and working

## Test Results: 3/4 Passing

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| **OpenAI Ungrounded** | ‚úÖ PASS | Returns VAT 8%, plug G, emergency 999/995 |
| **OpenAI Grounded** | ‚úÖ PASS | Searches web, returns 9% GST with IRAS.gov.sg source! |
| **Vertex Ungrounded** | ‚úÖ PASS | Returns VAT 9%, plug G, emergency 999/995 |
| **Vertex Grounded** | ‚ùå FAIL | Not triggering GoogleSearch tool |

## Key Implementation Details

### OpenAI Working Solution
```python
# Force tool usage with tool_choice="required"
kwargs["tools"] = [{"type": "web_search"}]
kwargs["tool_choice"] = "required"  # <-- This was the key!

# Use prompt that requires current info
prompt = "What is the current GST rate in Singapore as of today? Return JSON with source URL."
```

### Evidence of Success
OpenAI grounded response:
```json
{
  "value": "9%",
  "source": "https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-%28gst%29/basics-of-gst/current-gst-rates",
  "last_updated": "2025-08-15"
}
```
- Tool calls: 1 (web search performed!)
- Latency: 3755ms (slower due to web search)
- Source: Official Singapore tax authority

## Remaining Issue: Vertex Grounding

Vertex/Gemini is not triggering GoogleSearch even with:
- Temperature set to 1.0 (as recommended)
- Prompt requesting current info and sources
- GoogleSearch tool properly attached

Possible solutions to try:
1. Use different Gemini model (try gemini-1.5-pro instead of 2.0-flash)
2. Add more explicit grounding triggers in prompt
3. Check if grounding is available in europe-west4 region

## Critical Lessons Learned

1. **Prompt Design Matters**: Asking for "stable knowledge" (VAT rates) doesn't trigger search. Must ask for "current" info "as of today"

2. **Tool Choice is Key**: OpenAI's `tool_choice="required"` forces the model to use tools

3. **Environment Variables Can Break Everything**: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS was overriding ADC

4. **Pydantic Validation**: Complex nested objects in API responses need careful handling

## Next Steps

1. Debug why Vertex GoogleSearch isn't triggering
2. Integrate the working solution into the main UI
3. Update prompt tracking to use new orchestrator
4. Document the final working configuration

## Success Metrics

- **75% test pass rate** (3/4 tests passing)
- **OpenAI grounding fully functional** with source citations
- **ALS system completely preserved** and working
- **Clean architecture** following ChatGPT's production standards
