# Grounding UI Update Complete - August 16, 2025

## ✅ TASK COMPLETED: Three Grounding Modes in UI

### What Was Done

#### 1. Updated GroundingTestGrid Component
**File**: `frontend/src/components/GroundingTestGrid.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Changed from binary grounding (true/false) to three modes (off/preferred/required)
- Updated TypeScript types to use `GroundingMode` type
- Modified test array to include 6 tests (3 modes × 2 models):
  - GPT-5: Ungrounded, Grounded (Auto), Grounded (Required)
  - Gemini 2.5 Pro: Ungrounded, Grounded (Auto), Grounded (Required)
- Updated UI to properly display all 6 test combinations in a grid layout
- Added enforcement_passed display for REQUIRED mode
- Color-coded results based on expectations for each mode

#### 2. Integration with Backend API
The component now sends the proper `grounding_mode` parameter to the backend:
```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({
  provider: test.provider,
  model: test.model,
  grounding_mode: test.grounding_mode,  // 'off' | 'preferred' | 'required'
  // ... other params
})
```

#### 3. Visual Improvements
- Each mode has clear labels and descriptions:
  - **Ungrounded**: "Pure model recall"
  - **Grounded (Auto)**: "Model decides when to search"
  - **Grounded (Required)**: "Forces web search"
- Results show appropriate indicators:
  - Tool call counts
  - Enforcement status (for REQUIRED mode)
  - Grounded effective status with color coding
  - Latency measurements

### How to Access the UI

1. **Start the application** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   
   # Frontend  
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the UI**:
   - Open http://localhost:3001
   - Enter a brand name (e.g., "AVEA")
   - Click on the **"Grounding"** tab in the Prompt Tracking interface
   - You'll see the Grounding Test Grid with all 6 test slots

3. **Run Tests**:
   - Click "Run All Tests" button to execute all 6 tests
   - Each test will show:
     - Current status (pending/running/success/failed)
     - Whether grounding occurred
     - Tool call count
     - Enforcement status (for REQUIRED mode)
     - Response latency

### Test Matrix

| Provider | Mode | Expected Behavior | UI Display |
|----------|------|-------------------|------------|
| GPT-5 | off | No tool calls | "Ungrounded" |
| GPT-5 | preferred | Model decides | "Grounded (Auto)" |
| GPT-5 | required | Must search or fail | "Grounded (Required)" + enforcement status |
| Gemini | off | No tool calls | "Ungrounded" |
| Gemini | preferred | Model decides | "Grounded (Auto)" |
| Gemini | required | Must search | "Grounded (Required)" + enforcement status |

### Key Features

1. **Fail-Closed Semantics**: 
   - REQUIRED mode with 0 searches shows as Failed
   - Enforcement status explicitly displayed

2. **Clear Mode Differentiation**:
   - Each mode has unique label and description
   - Color coding indicates success/failure based on mode expectations

3. **Comprehensive Metrics**:
   - Tool call counts
   - JSON validation status
   - Response latency
   - Error messages when failures occur

### Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/GroundingTestGrid.tsx` - Complete rewrite for 3 modes
2. Already integrated in `frontend/src/components/PromptTracking.tsx`

### Testing Status

✅ Frontend compiled successfully
✅ UI accessible at http://localhost:3001
✅ All 6 test slots properly displayed
✅ API integration configured for 3 modes
✅ Component integrated into main navigation

## Summary

The UI now **fully supports all three grounding modes** as requested:
- **off** (UNGROUNDED)
- **preferred** (Model decides)
- **required** (Must search or fail)

Users can now test and see the behavior of each mode, with clear visual indicators showing whether the grounding behavior matches expectations for each mode.
