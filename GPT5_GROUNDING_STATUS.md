# GPT-5 Grounding Implementation Status

**Date**: August 15, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ GROUNDING WORKING! JSON schema pending

## ✅ What's Working

### Web Search Grounding via Responses API
- **Grounded mode successfully makes web searches!** 
- Tool calls are being made (tool_call_count = 1 when grounded)
- Citations and search results are injected into responses
- Using correct `client.responses.create()` syntax
- Properly falls back to Chat Completions when Responses API unavailable

### Infrastructure Complete
- Created `OpenAIResponsesAdapter` with proper client syntax
- Updated `langchain_adapter.py` to route grounded requests to Responses API
- Updated `prompt_tracking.py` to pass grounding parameter
- Database columns tracking: `tool_call_count`, `grounded_effective`, `json_valid`
- Historical data corrected (26 fake grounded tests marked as invalid)
- OpenAI SDK upgraded to 1.99.9

## 🚧 What's Pending

### JSON Schema Enforcement
- `response_format` with `json_schema` not yet working in Responses API
- Falls back to Chat Completions for JSON requests
- May need to wait for full deployment or API update

## Current Behavior

### Grounded Mode (WORKING!)
```python
# What we send to OpenAI:
response = await client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    input=[...],
    tools=[{"type": "web_search"}],
    tool_choice="auto"
)

# What happens:
# ✅ OpenAI performs web search
# ✅ Returns search results in response
# ✅ tool_call_count = 1
# ✅ grounded_effective = True
```

### Ungrounded Mode (WORKING!)
```python
# No tools parameter sent
# ✅ tool_call_count = 0
# ✅ grounded_effective = False
```

### JSON Schema Mode (FALLBACK)
```python
# response_format parameter not yet supported
# Falls back to Chat Completions API
# Still returns valid JSON but without strict schema enforcement
```

## Test Results

```bash
cd backend && python test_openai_responses.py
```

Current results:
- ✅ Ungrounded: tool_call_count = 0 (correct)
- ✅ Grounded: tool_call_count = 1 (web search working!)
- ⚠️ JSON schema: Falls back to Chat Completions

## 4-Column Test Grid Status

| Feature | GPT-5 Ungrounded | GPT-5 Grounded | Gemini Ungrounded | Gemini Grounded |
|---------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| API | Responses ✅ | Responses ✅ | Vertex (pending) | Vertex (pending) |
| Web Search | No ✅ | Yes ✅ | No | Yes (GoogleSearch) |
| JSON Schema | Fallback ⚠️ | Fallback ⚠️ | Pending | Pending |

## Next Steps

1. ✅ ~~Fix Responses API client syntax~~ DONE
2. ✅ ~~Implement web search grounding~~ DONE
3. 🚧 Wait for `response_format` support in Responses API
4. 📋 Implement Vertex adapter with structured JSON
5. 📋 Create full 4-column test grid UI
6. 📋 Update ALS blocks to ≤350 chars

## The Good News

- **Web search grounding is WORKING!**
- Infrastructure is complete and correct
- Proper API usage with client.responses.create()
- Tool calls are tracked accurately
- Fallback mechanism ensures reliability

## The Current Limitation

- JSON schema enforcement not yet available in Responses API
- Falls back gracefully to Chat Completions for JSON requests
- This may be a deployment timing issue

## Bottom Line

**Major success!** GPT-5/GPT-4o grounding via web search is now functional. The Responses API is working correctly and performing web searches when requested. JSON schema enforcement will likely be added soon as the API matures.
