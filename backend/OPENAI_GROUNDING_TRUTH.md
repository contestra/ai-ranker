# OpenAI Grounding Truth - Authoritative Findings

## Executive Summary
After extensive testing with official OpenAI Responses API, here are the definitive findings about web search grounding support:

### Model Support Matrix

| Model | tool_choice:"required" | tool_choice:"auto" | Actual Searching | Output Quality |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **GPT-4o** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | ✅ Works | ✅ Valid JSON |
| **GPT-4o-mini** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | ✅ Works | ✅ Valid JSON |
| **GPT-5** | ❌ Returns 400 | ✅ Accepted | ❌ Never searches | ❌ Empty output |
| **GPT-5-mini** | ❌ Returns 400 | ✅ Accepted | ❌ Never searches | ❌ Empty output |
| **GPT-5-nano** | ❌ Returns 400 | ✅ Accepted | ❌ Never searches | ❌ Empty output |

## Key Findings

### 1. GPT-5 Models Have Critical Limitations
- **Cannot use `tool_choice:"required"`** - Returns HTTP 400: "Tool choices other than 'auto' are not supported with model 'gpt-5' and the following tool types: 'web_search_preview'"
- **With `tool_choice:"auto"` they don't search** - Even for queries explicitly asking for current information
- **Return empty output_text** - The response has status 200 but output_text is empty

### 2. GPT-4o Models Work Perfectly
- **Support `tool_choice:"required"`** - Forces web search as documented
- **Actually perform searches** - Returns `web_search_call` items in output
- **Return valid JSON** - With proper content in output_text field
- **Successfully enforce REQUIRED mode** - Can fail closed when search is mandatory

### 3. Implementation Corrections Applied
Based on authoritative sources ([OpenAI Cookbook][1], [OpenAI Platform][2]):

1. **Correct tool type**: `{"type": "web_search"}` ✅
2. **Correct response type**: Count `web_search_call` items ✅
3. **Correct enforcement**: Use `tool_choice:"required"` for GPT-4o ✅
4. **Correct extraction**: Parse output items for message content ✅

## Test Results

### GPT-4o with REQUIRED Mode
```python
Request:
- model: "gpt-4o"
- tools: [{"type": "web_search"}]
- tool_choice: "required"
- prompt: "What is the VAT rate in Germany?"

Response:
- Status: 200 OK
- Web search calls: 1
- Output: Valid JSON {"vat_percent": "19%", ...}
- Grounding effective: True
```

### GPT-5 with REQUIRED Mode
```python
Request:
- model: "gpt-5"
- tools: [{"type": "web_search"}]
- tool_choice: "required"

Response:
- Status: 400 Bad Request
- Error: "Tool choices other than 'auto' are not supported"
```

### GPT-5 with AUTO Mode
```python
Request:
- model: "gpt-5"
- tools: [{"type": "web_search"}]
- tool_choice: "auto"
- prompt: "What is the current weather?"

Response:
- Status: 200 OK
- Web search calls: 0
- Output text: "" (empty)
- No search performed despite explicit request
```

## Recommendations

1. **Use GPT-4o models for grounding tests** - They fully support required web search
2. **Avoid GPT-5 models for now** - They have fundamental issues with web search
3. **Count `web_search_call` items** - This is the correct way to verify searches
4. **Enforce REQUIRED mode properly** - Fail closed if no search when required

## Code Changes Made

1. Updated test grid to use GPT-4o models instead of GPT-5
2. Added early return for GPT-5 in capability probe (known not to support required)
3. Fixed temperature handling (GPT-4o doesn't need 1.0 like GPT-5)
4. Maintained proper web_search_call counting logic

## Conclusion

The statement "GPT-5 won't search for VAT rates no matter what we do" turned out to be **TRUE** - but not for the reasons initially thought. GPT-5 has fundamental limitations with the Responses API that prevent both forced searching (tool_choice:"required" not supported) and voluntary searching (tool_choice:"auto" doesn't trigger searches).

GPT-4o models, however, work exactly as documented and can enforce required web searches successfully.
