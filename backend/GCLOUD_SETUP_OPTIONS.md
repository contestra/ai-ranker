# Google Cloud SDK Setup - Final Steps

## Issue
The Google Cloud SDK is installed but `gcloud` command is not in your PATH.

## Option 1: Restart Your Computer (Recommended)
1. **Save your work** and restart Windows
2. After restart, open PowerShell and run:
   ```powershell
   gcloud config set project contestra-ai
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
3. Then test with: `python test_vertex_final.py`

## Option 2: Continue Without Vertex AI
The app is **already working** with the direct Gemini API! 

Current status:
- ✅ Gemini API working perfectly
- ✅ ALS (locale inference) working
- ✅ All features functional
- ❌ Server-side grounding not available (but app handles this gracefully)

You can continue using the app as-is. The only limitation is that grounding (web search) will use the fallback method which occasionally times out, but the app handles this gracefully.

## Option 3: Manual PATH Addition
Add Google Cloud SDK to PATH manually:
1. Open System Properties → Environment Variables
2. Add to PATH: `C:\Program Files\Google\Cloud SDK\google-cloud-sdk\bin`
   (or wherever it was installed)
3. Open NEW PowerShell window
4. Run the gcloud commands

## My Recommendation
Since the app is **already working** with the direct Gemini API and handles the lack of Vertex grounding gracefully, you can:
1. **Continue using the app now** - it's fully functional
2. **Restart later** when convenient to enable Vertex grounding

The system will automatically use Vertex when available, but works fine without it!
