PROMPT SENT: AVEA

RESPONSE:
Of course. "Avea" most commonly refers to the former Turkish mobile network operator. However, it can also be an acronym for several organizations.

Here are the most common meanings:

### 1. Avea (The Turkish Telecom Company)

This is the most well-known use of the name.

*   **What it was:** Avea was one of the three major mobile network operators in Turkey, alongside Turkcell and Vodafone Turkey.
*   **History:** It was founded in 2004 after the merger of two other operators, Aycell (owned by Türk Telekom) and Aria (a joint venture between İş Bankası and Telecom Italia Mobile).
*   **End of the Brand:** In **January 2016**, Avea's parent company, Türk Telekom, decided to consolidate its brands. The Avea brand was discontinued, and all mobile, landline, and internet services were merged under the single **Türk Telekom** brand.

So, if you see old branding or hear someone refer to their mobile service as "Avea" in Turkey, they are talking about the company that is now part of Türk Telekom.
