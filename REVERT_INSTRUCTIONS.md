# CRITICAL: Revert Instructions to Restore Working State

## The Problem
The Ambient Location Signals (ALS) locale testing is broken after attempted code cleanup:
- Tests show amber warning boxes instead of green checkmarks
- Progress indicators (1/3, 2/3, 3/3) no longer display during testing
- The test-with-progress endpoint may not be streaming correctly
- Everything was working perfectly before the cleanup attempt

## Last Known Good State
The last commit before any cleanup changes:
- **Commit Hash**: `dc65468`
- **Message**: "Update documentation with complete parser implementation and 100% success status"
- **Date**: Before the CODE_CLEANUP.md was created

## Revert Instructions

### Option 1: Hard Reset (Recommended)
```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Save any important uncommitted work (if any)
git stash

# Reset to last known good state
git reset --hard dc65468

# Force push to remote
git push --force origin master
```

### Option 2: Revert Commits
```bash
# Revert the cleanup attempts
git revert 700417d  # Revert "Add Prompt Wizard feature"
git revert ebcca93  # Revert "Add code cleanup analysis" 
git revert 0b9edab  # Revert "Standardize API router prefixes"
git revert adba663  # Revert "Fix countries endpoint routing"

# Push the reverts
git push origin master
```

### Option 3: Checkout Previous State
```bash
# Create a new branch from the good state
git checkout -b restore-working-state dc65468

# Replace master with this branch
git branch -f master restore-working-state
git checkout master
git push --force origin master
```

## What Was Changed (and Broke Things)
1. **Router Prefix Changes**: Modified how API routes are prefixed in `main.py`
   - Changed prompt_tracking, health, and countries routers
   - This likely broke the streaming endpoints

2. **Countries Router**: The `/api/countries/test-with-progress` endpoint stopped working correctly
   - Progress indicators no longer display
   - May have affected the SSE (Server-Sent Events) streaming

## Verification After Revert

After reverting, verify everything works:

1. **Test Countries Tab**:
   - Go to Countries tab
   - Click "Locale Check" for any country
   - Should see progress: "Testing (1/3)... (2/3)... (3/3)"
   - Should show green checkmark when all pass
   - Click info icon should show correct results

2. **Test Endpoints Directly**:
   ```bash
   # Test the countries list
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/countries
   
   # Test the progress endpoint (should stream)
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/countries/test-with-progress \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"country_code":"US","vendor":"google","model":"gemini"}'
   ```

3. **Check Parser**:
   - All 8 countries should show green when tests pass
   - Parser should handle all variations (comma decimals, plug synonyms, etc.)

## Files That Were Modified
- `backend/app/main.py` - Router prefix changes (MAIN ISSUE)
- `CODE_CLEANUP.md` - New file (can be deleted)
- Various documentation files

## Current Git Status
```
Current HEAD: 700417d (attempted rollback, but still broken)
Last Good: dc65468 (before any cleanup)
```

## Lessons Learned
1. The countries router has complex SSE streaming that's sensitive to routing changes
2. The test-with-progress endpoint requires specific routing configuration
3. Router prefixes interact in complex ways between the router definition and main.py inclusion
4. Always test streaming endpoints thoroughly after routing changes

## Immediate Action Required
Execute Option 1 (Hard Reset) immediately to restore functionality:
```bash
git reset --hard dc65468
git push --force origin master
```

Then restart both backend and frontend services to ensure clean state.

If issues persist after revert, the problem may be environmental rather than code-related.
